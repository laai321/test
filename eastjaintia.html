            <h3>EAST JAINTIA HILLS</h3>
<article style="align-content: stretch; text-align: justify;">The East Jaintia Hills is one of the 11 districts of Meghalaya, a state in northeastern India. It is located in the eastern part of the Jaintia Hills region, which is known for its scenic beauty, lush green landscapes, and rich cultural heritage. The district headquarters of East Jaintia Hills is Khliehriat. The Jaintia Hills are named after the Jaintia tribe, which is one of the major tribal communities in Meghalaya. The Jaintia people have their distinct language, customs, and traditions. They primarily practice agriculture, with terraced farming being one of their traditional forms of cultivation. The East Jaintia Hills district is known for its coal reserves and coal mining, which has been an important economic activity in the region for many decades. However, coal mining has also had significant environmental and social impacts, with issues related to land rights, forest degradation, and pollution being important concerns in the region. Apart from coal mining, the district is also known for its rich biodiversity, with several rivers, waterfalls, caves, and forests that are home to diverse flora and fauna. The region is also known for its traditional arts, crafts, and cultural festivals, which showcase the unique heritage of the Jaintia and other indigenous tribes. The district is predominantly rural, with agriculture being the main occupation of the local population. Apart from terraced farming, other agricultural practices such as wetland cultivation, horticulture, and animal husbandry are also practiced in the district. However, the challenges of sustainable agriculture, land management, and natural resource conservation are important issues faced by the local communities. The East Jaintia Hills district, like other parts of Meghalaya, faces the dual challenge of balancing economic development with environmental conservation and preservation of indigenous cultures. Efforts are being made to promote sustainable livelihoods, protect natural resources, and preserve the cultural heritage of the Jaintia and other indigenous tribes in the region. In summary, the East Jaintia Hills district is known for its coal mining, scenic beauty, cultural richness, and unique way of life of the Jaintia and other indigenous communities residing in the region. It is an important part of the cultural and natural diversity of Meghalaya, and contributes to the overall heritage and identity of the state.</article>
